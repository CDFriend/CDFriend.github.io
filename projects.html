    <h3>NWHacks 2018 - 'Dash' Banking Bot</h3>

    <p>
        Dash was an attempt at making a conversational interface to banking. My team and I used
        Microsoft Cognitive Services' LUIS for natural language processing, several microservices
        to simulate a bank's internal systems and an Android app to interface with everything.

    <p>
        I primarily focused on authentication services for this project. I decided to make my own token-based
        authentication system using a Python microservice, which actually ended up working well! I started with 
        basic username/password credentials, and tried to integrate MCS' voice authentication near the end of 
        the event. Did I need to make my own? No. Was it super fun? Absolutely.
