    <h3>NWHacks 2018 - 'Dash' Banking Bot</h3>

    <p>
        Dash was an attempt at making a conversational interface to banking. My team and I used
        Microsoft Cognitive Services' LUIS for natural language processing, several microservices
        to simulate a bank's internal systems and an Android app to interface with everything.
    </p>

    <p>
        I primarily focused on authentication services for this project. I decided to make my own token-based
        authentication system using a Python microservice, which actually ended up working well! I started with 
        basic username/password credentials, and tried to integrate MCS' voice authentication near the end of 
        the event. Did I need to make my own? No. Was it super fun? Absolutely.

    <h3>Battlesnake (2016-2019)</h3>

    <p>
        <a href="https://battlesnake.io">Battlesnake</a> is an annual hackathon in Victoria, BC where
        AIs are programmed to play the cell phone game snake. The rules are relatively simple: there are 
        several snakes on the board, and you must survive for as long as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        I've been attending Battlesnake since I started studying Computer Science, and have enjoyed using 
        what I've learned in class to make more and more sophisticated snakes. Since I started, I've contributed
        to a whole family of snakes:
